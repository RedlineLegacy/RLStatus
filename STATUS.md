#RLStatus
Some of you have already noticed that I'm working on Redline 1.1.

`joebagonuts` asked for some kind of process or status page, so here it is. :smile:

**Please note:** Redline 1.1 will have (nearly) *no* new features! It will *just* work on Mavericks and Yosemite and will use a new tracker and lobby server.


Development Status
---


Name | Description | Status
-----|-------------|--------
Code cleanup | The code is (partly very) old and needs rework to run | Finished :heavy_check_mark:
Beta Tests | Adding a crash reporter, for the beta builds | Finished :heavy_check_mark:
Renew updater | Rewrite Redline's builtin updater | Finished :heavy_check_mark:

Rewrite Multiplayer Lobby | The lobby currently works with ASWs server; change structure and server | Finished :heavy_check_mark:
Rewrite Multiplayer P2P | Rewrite in-game (Point-to-Point) communication | *Waiting*
Tracker/Server | Impossible to use ASWs Tracker anymore (cya old records :sob:) | **Working**
Remove ASW Framework | Due to copyright problems, I can't distribute the ASW framework. Must be completely replaced. (Just the Sound Libraries are left! :smile:) | **Working**
Remove Carbon Framework | [Carbon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_(API)) is old (used for OS9/OSX, so from ~2001) and needs to be removed for 64-bit support | **Working**
Online Overview | Create a webpage with a) lap times, b) the Mulitplayer lobby | *Waiting*


I'll send out Beta Builds as soon as I finished the things on this list.

Beta Testers
---

The following people have asked to be beta testers:

- Valentin K
- Aleksi
- Michael (`joebagonuts`)
- Steven (`Amp`)
- Aldo (`kopje`)
- Bob (`bobrk`)
- Laurids
- Peter (`AmateurLobster`)

If you want to be a Beta Tester too, ask me. Please note that this could get really annoying, as Redline Beta is not stable and will likely crash. And I'll ask many questions about that...
