#RLStatus
Some of you have already noticed that I'm working on Redline 1.1.

`joebagonuts` asked for some kind of process or status page, so here it is. :smile:


Development Status
---


Name | Description | Status
-|-|-
Code cleanup | The code is (partly very) old and needs rework to run | Finished :heavy_check_mark:
Beta Tests | Adding a crash reporter, for the beta builds | Finished :heavy_check_mark:
Renew updater | Rewrite Redline's builtin updater | Finished :heavy_check_mark:
Rewrite Time Trial | The underlying structure isn't usable | **Working**
Rewrite Multiplayer | The whole Multiplayer communication needs to be rewritten | *Waiting*
Tracker/Server | Impossible to use ASWs Tracker anymore :sob: (cya records...) | **Working**
Remove ASW Framework | Due to copyright problems, I can't distribute the ASW framework. Must be completely replaced. | **Working**
Online Overview | Create a webpage with a) lap times, b) the Mulitplayer lobby | *Waiting*


I'll send out Beta Builds as soon as I finished the things on this list.

Beta Testers
---

The following people have asked to be beta testers:

- Valentin K
- Aleksi

If you want to test it, too, ask me. Please note that this could get really annoying, as Redline Beta is not stable and will likely crash. And I'll ask many questions about that...
